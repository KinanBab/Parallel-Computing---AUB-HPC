# Parallel-Computing---AUB-HPC
These are Assignment (Some are Bonus) For the Parallel Computing Course. They are writtend in a variety of C++-based parallel libraries.
they are mostly simple tasks, but they served well as an introduction to the SIMD/Parallel World, Not only programming-wise, but also from a design and analysis of algorithm's prespective.
The codes were all run and benchmarked using The available HPC at AUB.
